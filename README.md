I am a Full Stack Developer with an interest in Aritificial Intelligence. My programming experience comes from creating AI in Python and Tensorflow, creating Websites ([like this one!](https://thinkr3.github.io/)) in HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JS, JQuery, and creating Desktop Applications in Java, C#, and React. I am mainly applying my programming knowledge by participating in Hackathons. I also have many other interests such as research, gaming, and art.
